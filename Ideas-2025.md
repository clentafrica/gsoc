# CLENT Africa GSoC 2025 DRAFT Project Ideas

This page lists DRAFT project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2025. For more information about this project and application details, visit the CLENT Africa Google Summer of Code page.

- Below are the drafts of proposed project ideas for this year.
- New ideas can be suggested by interested mentors or GSoC contributors (e.g., new features in the core, "develop a tool for MY_CLIMATE_TECHNOLOGY", etc.).
- Projects without potential mentors will be considered, but applicants may need to collaborate with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors.
- To add a new project idea, see: proposing project ideas.

## Accepted Ideas

This will be a list of project ideas that fully meet the CLENT Africa project idea standards. 
- These will ideas have well-defined scopes, and we generally do not expect significant changes.
- All ideas will include quick start guidelines and newbie-friendly issues.
- We welcome contributors to join the mentor teams and invite GSoC contributors to submit project proposal applications for these ideas.

## Draft Ideas

The **16 initial project ideas** that are presented below are drafts that are being looked over right now. The overall idea is accepted, but specifics could change as the discussion goes on. 
- You are welcome to become a mentor for the project and offer comments on the draft.
- If you are a GSoC contributor, you are also welcome to look into and apply to the draft project ideas.
