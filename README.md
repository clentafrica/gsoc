## Introduction
Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. See [GSoC 2025 how it works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).

CLENT Africa intends to be a Google Summer of Code 2025 mentoring organization. This will be our first year participating, and we are excited to welcome mentors and contributors.

## Students

Please get involved.
- Read this document to learn how to apply as a contibutor for the GSoC program with CLENT Africa.
- Please also check out our [ideas](Ideas-2025.md) list. We would love to hear your own ideas as well.
- For any questions, please open an issue in our issue tracker or send a email to gsoc@clentafrica.org
- You may use our [proposal template](Template.md) or your own.

In addition to the [Google Summer of Code requirements for a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal), proposals for CLENT Africa:
* Must be your own work, and not the work of others, except where the work of others is minimal, duly credited, and quoted.
* Must show you are fluent in the programming language needed.
* Must show your assessment of the competency of your mentors.
* Should be posted as GitHub Markdown or PDF, and supported with answers to any questions posted in reply.
* Should **not** be posted as a Google Doc.

For students who wish to be able to delete their proposal after failing to win a project, please do not post it on our mailing list. Our decisions will be based on the contents of the final PDF proposal and our interactions with the student.

## Mentors
Read this document to learn what is required of you as GSoC mentor with CLENT Africa.

## How to talk to us?
- We use the [GSoC Email](gsoc@clentafrica.org) for only direct and important communication. Allow some days for a reply. 
- We also have a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/u5yWdGNmyR) where you can talk with other community members. Join to participate in the discussion and ask for help. See [Community etiquette](https://github.com/clentafrica/GSoC#community-etiquette).
- Do not write secretly to mentors or developers unless they have asked you to. This varies by project idea. Check the list of coding mentors for each project.

## How to Contribute
At CLENT Africa, we have [opportunities for contributing](https://github.com/clentafrica/docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md) with many different [programming languages and libraries](https://github.com/clentafrica/docs/blob/master/src/languages.md).

## Getting Help
Got a problem? Ask your mentors, ask other students, or ask the CLENT Africa community.

The CLENT Africa community is large, and there are people who are not mentors in the contest. Mentors are listed. Everyone else you talk with may be a non-mentor.

Students should keep in mind that some people are non-mentors, and cannot see the contest progress, dates, or information about students. When communicating widely, be sure to:
* Introduce yourself the first time.
* Talk about the task as if you want to do it yourself, not because of the contest.
* Defend your technical decisions without using the contest as a defense.
* Non-mentors may give good guidance on technical decisions, but bad guidance on how they think a task is judged. Always consult with your mentors as well.

## Community etiquette
Everyone in the community has to be polite and respectful, and consider everyone else a member of a team and not a competitor.

One should be considerate of everyone else's time. We would like to have quality discussions and not answer questions that are already documented or available on Stack Overflow. 

Tell things as you see them. Be polite, but don't sugarcoat it. You don't have to apologize every time you make a mistake; but avoid repeating it again.

See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clentafrica/docs/blob/master/src/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Accepted ideas
This will be a list of project ideas that fully match CLENT Africa's project idea standard. 
- The scope of these ideas will be well known and we won't normally expect deep changes.
- All ideas will have quick start guidelines and newbie-friendly issues referenced.
- We welcome contributors to join the mentor teams, and we invite GSoC contributors to submit project proposal applications in relation to these ideas.

## Draft Project Ideas for 2025
Below you can find project ideas which have been proposed for 2025. 
- New ideas may be proposed by interested mentors or GSoC contributors.
- Project ideas without potential mentors will be considered, though applicants may need to work with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors.
